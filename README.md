# El Alto Spaces Plugin
This is a convolution reverb that simulates the responses of three different rooms of El Alto Estudio, a recording and mixing studio located at El Retiro, Medellin. 
The impulse responses were obtained by doing measurements of every room using the sine sweep method, and then process with MATLAB.
It was developed with the JUCE framework.
