# El Alto Spaces Plugin
This is a convolution reverb that simulates the responses of three different rooms of El Alto Estudio, a recording and mixing studio located at El Retiro, Medellin, Colombia.
The impulse responses were obtained by doing measurements of every room using the sine sweep method, then process them with MATLAB and finally developed with JUCE. 

## Modules and Interface

- In/out knobs control and level meters
- Rooms buttons for the selection of the rooms and parameter changes such as position, type of mics and type of speakers
- Two filters with a frequency knob adjuster
- Dry/wet mix
